# ʻākohekohe ZMK Config

Example ZMK config for the ['ākohekohe](https://github.com/grassfedreeve/akohekohe/), originally used as an example to be forked. No longer necessary as you should now use the [ākohekohe ZMK Module](https://github.com/grassfedreeve/zmk-keyboards-akohekohe) instead of forking.

# Keymap
Example keymap for how you might use this many keys, created using caksoylar's great [keymap-drawer](https://github.com/caksoylar/keymap-drawer)

By default I have enabled caksoylar's [zmk-rgbled-widget](https://github.com/caksoylar/zmk-rgbled-widget) on the bluetooth build, which is so fantastic that anyone using a xiao ble should use it.
